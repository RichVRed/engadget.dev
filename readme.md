## REST API for Blog Application

### Objective
Write an example of a REST API for a blog application. Develop the api endpoints, database schema and sample classes that would run the application. 

### Guidelines/Limitations
* Use any backend language you prefer. We use PHP and Node.js, MySQL and MongoDB here, so they would be preferential over other languages and database systems.
* Write a shell of the classes and methods needed for the CRUD operations necessary for the blog app, leaving the logic in pseudocode.
* The article body must be saved as structured content, separating headers from text from images. How would you save the content to be client-agonistic, such that it can be consumed natively on mobile, web, etc?
* Reference or specify any libraries you might use outside of the pseudocode.
* Due to time constraints, feel free to pseudocode although we wouldn't object to code that we can run
* User authentication is managed outside of the application, i.e. with FB login
* For simplicity, user's data is stored, but they cannot update their profile

### Base Application Functionality
* Retrieve list of recent blog posts by date and user
* Create, read, update, delete individual blog posts
* Provide an example response or endpoint that returns an example response
* Provide a README with steps to run or step through your API
